# Overview

Generators are part of the stack templates' functionality. They provide end users with prompt messages, asking to  fill required stack values in an interactive mode and thereby create stack parts without deep knowledge of infrastructure code.

This could be helpful for developers who need to spin up new stacks but lack infrastructure coding skills, or in case of quick infrastructure deployment from ready parts (units).
