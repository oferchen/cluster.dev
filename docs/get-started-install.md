# Install From Script

!!! tip

    This is the easiest way to have the Cluster.dev client installed. For other options refer to [Install From Sources](https://docs.cluster.dev/get-started-install-from-sources/).

Cluster.dev has an installer script that takes the latest version of Cluster.dev client and installs it for you locally.<br> 

Fetch the script and execute it locally with the command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shalb/cluster.dev/master/scripts/get_cdev.sh | sh
```
