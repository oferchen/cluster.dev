# Cluster.dev - Cloud Infrastructures' Management Tool

Cluster.dev is an open-source tool designed to manage cloud native infrastructures with simple declarative manifests - stack templates. It allows you to describe a whole infrastructure and deploy it with a single tool.

The stack templates could be based on Terraform modules, Kubernetes manifests, Shell scripts, Helm charts and ArgoCD/Flux applications, OPA policies, etc. Cluster.dev sticks those components together so that you could deploy, test and distribute a whole set of components with pinned versions.
